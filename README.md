# I2C Encoder
The I2C Encoder is a small board where you can use a classical mechanical encoder with a I2C bus. The device
include also the possibility to add a bi-color LED and set luminosity trough the I2C bus. Itâ€™s possible to connect up
to 16 boards in cascade and read all of them with the same I2C bus.
The I2C Encoder have a series of 8 bit register where it is possible to configure the parameters and three 32
bit of register. The 32 bit registers are the most important because they store the counter value and the maximum
and minimum threshold. Every time when the encoder is moved at least one step, the counter value is increased or
decreased according to the rotation direction. When the counter value is outside of the limit set by the threshold,
the counter value can be wrapped or can stuck on the threshold valued reached.
The I2C Encoder also has an open-drain interrupt pin. It is set to logic low every time when the encoder is rotated
or pushed. The status register must be read by the master to check what is changed.
